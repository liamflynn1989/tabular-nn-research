## Implemented Models

### 1. TabR: Retrieval-Augmented Tabular Learning (ICLR 2024)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2307.14338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14338)

Combines deep learning with k-NN-style retrieval from training data. For each prediction, retrieves similar training examples and uses attention to aggregate their information.

**Key Features:**
- Soft attention-based retrieval (differentiable end-to-end)
- Uses both features and labels from retrieved neighbors
- Excellent for finding similar historical patterns (regime detection)
- Best performance on moderate-dimensional data

**HFT/MFT Relevance:**
- Finds similar historical market patterns
- Explainable via retrieved neighbors (regulatory compliance)
- Implicit ensemble benefits for noise handling

⚠️ **Note:** TabR struggles with very high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality affecting k-NN retrieval. Consider dimensionality reduction for datasets with 50+ features.

### 2. TabKANet: KAN-based Numerical Embeddings (Knowledge-Based Systems 2025)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2409.08806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08806)

Uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with learnable B-spline activation functions to embed numerical features.

**Key Features:**
- B-spline based learnable activation functions
- Transformer encoder for feature interactions
- Supports both numerical and categorical features

### 3. TabM: Parameter-Efficient Ensembling (ICLR 2025)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2410.24210](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24210)

Efficiently imitates an ensemble of MLPs using batch-like computation with weight sharing.

**Key Features:**
- Parameter-efficient ensembling via weight sharing
- Simple MLP backbone with BatchEnsemble-style computation
- State-of-the-art performance among tabular DL models

### 4. Feature-aware Temporal Modulation (NeurIPS 2025)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2512.03678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03678)

Addresses temporal distribution shifts by conditioning feature representations on temporal context.

**Key Features:**
- Handles concept drift via feature-aware modulation
- FiLM-style modulation for dynamic adaptation
- Balances generalizability and adaptability

### 5. iLTM: Integrated Large Tabular Model (arXiv 2025)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2511.15941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15941)

An integrated tabular foundation model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, MLPs, and retrieval into a single architecture. Pretrained on 1800+ heterogeneous classification datasets.

**Key Features:**
- **GBDT Leaf Embeddings:** Uses gradient-boosted decision tree leaf indices as one-hot encoded features
- **Dimensionality-Agnostic Representation:** Random feature expansion + PCA for consistent embedding sizes
- **Hypernetwork:** Meta-trained network that generates MLP weights from training data statistics
- **Soft Retrieval:** Cosine-similarity based k-NN that blends with MLP predictions
- **Transfer Learning:** Classification pretraining transfers to regression tasks

**HFT/MFT Relevance:**
- Tree embeddings capture regime-like patterns in market data
- Retrieval finds similar historical market conditions
- Robust to distribution shift via GBDT inductive biases
- Works across varying feature dimensions (useful for multi-asset strategies)

⚠️ **Note:** This implementation is a simplified version without the meta-trained hypernetwork weights. For the full pretrained model achieving state-of-the-art results, see: https://github.com/AI-sandbox/iLTM

### 7. AMFormer: Arithmetic Feature Interaction Transformer (AAAI 2024)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2402.02334](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02334)

Introduces parallel additive AND multiplicative attention mechanisms to capture both sum-based and product-based feature interactions. The key insight is that standard transformers only model additive combinations (weighted sums), but tabular data often has multiplicative relationships (e.g., price × quantity = revenue).

**Key Features:**
- **Multiplicative Attention:** Computes weighted products of values in log-space, naturally capturing x1 × x2 patterns
- **Parallel Attention:** Both additive and multiplicative branches with learnable mixing
- **Token Descent:** Progressive feature reduction across layers for efficiency
- **Prompt Tokens:** Learnable task-conditioning tokens

**HFT/MFT Relevance:**
- Financial ratios and spreads are naturally multiplicative (bid/ask, P/E ratios)
- Polynomial terms in technical indicators (squared returns, volatility)
- Can capture interactions like momentum × volume

⚠️ **Note:** AMFormer underperforms on some synthetic benchmarks, particularly friedman (RMSE 4.95 vs 1.12-1.30 for other models). The multiplicative attention may introduce training instability or require careful hyperparameter tuning. Consider for domains with known multiplicative feature relationships.

### 8. On Embeddings for Numerical Features (NeurIPS 2022)
**Paper:** [arXiv:2203.05556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05556)

Demonstrates that transforming scalar numerical features into high-dimensional embeddings before mixing in the backbone significantly improves tabular neural network performance. Introduces two key embedding approaches.

**Key Features:**
- **Piecewise Linear Encoding (PLE):** Encodes scalars using learnable bin boundaries, creating sparse interpretable representations
- **Periodic Embeddings:** Uses sin/cos functions with learnable frequencies (similar to Fourier features)
- Simple MLPs with embeddings can match complex Transformer-based architectures
- Helps networks learn complex, non-linear feature-target relationships

**HFT/MFT Relevance:**
- Price/volume data often has multi-modal distributions that benefit from embeddings
- Periodic embeddings can capture cyclical patterns (intraday effects, round numbers)
- Piecewise linear bins adapt to different price/volume regimes automatically
- Low computational overhead - suitable for real-time inference
